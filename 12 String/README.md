# Strings


In computer programming, a string is a sequence of characters. For example, "hello" is a string containing a sequence of characters 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', and 'o'.

We use single quotes or double quotes to represent a string in Python. For example,
```python
# create a string using double quotes
string1 = "Python programming"

# create a string using single quotes
string1 = 'Python programming'
```
Here, we have created a string variable named string1. The variable is initialized with the string Python Programming.
Example: Python String
```python
# create string type variables

name = "Python"
print(name)

message = "I love Python."
print(message)
```

Output
```python
Python
I love Python.
```
In the above example, we have created string-type variables: name and message with values "Python" and "I love Python" respectively.

Here, we have used double quotes to represent strings but we can use single quotes too.
Access String Characters in Python

We can access the characters in a string in three ways.
```python
# Indexing: One way is to treat strings as a list and use index values. For example,

greet = 'hello'

# access 1st index element
print(greet[1]) # "e"
```

Negative Indexing: Similar to a list, Python allows negative indexing for its strings. For example,
```python
greet = 'hello'

# access 4th last element
print(greet[-4]) # "e"
```
Slicing: Access a range of characters in a string by using the slicing operator colon :. For example,
```python
greet = 'Hello'

# access character from 1st index to 3rd index
print(greet[1:4])  # "ell"
```
Note: If we try to access an index out of the range or use numbers other than an integer, we will get errors.
Python Strings are immutable

In Python, strings are immutable. That means the characters of a string cannot be changed. For example,
```python
message = 'Hola Amigos'
message[0] = 'H'
print(message)
```
Output
```python
# TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment

# However, we can assign the variable name to a new string. For example,

message = 'Hola Amigos'

# assign new string to message variable
message = 'Hello Friends'

prints(message); # prints "Hello Friends"

```

Python Multiline String

We can also create a multiline string in Python. For this, we use triple double quotes """ or triple single quotes '''. For example,
```python
# multiline string 
message = """
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
"""

print(message)
```
Output
```python
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
```
In the above example, anything inside the enclosing triple-quotes is one multiline string.
Python String Operations

There are many operations that can be performed with strings which makes it one of the most used data types in Python.
## 1. Compare Two Strings

We use the == operator to compare two strings. If two strings are equal, the operator returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. For example,
```python
str1 = "Hello, world!"
str2 = "I love Python."
str3 = "Hello, world!"

# compare str1 and str2
print(str1 == str2)

# compare str1 and str3
print(str1 == str3)
```

Output
```python
False
True
```
In the above example,

str1 and str2 are not equal. Hence, the result is False.
str1 and str3 are equal. Hence, the result is True.

## 2. Join Two or More Strings

In Python, we can join (concatenate) two or more strings using the + operator.

```python
greet = "Hello, "
name = "Jack"

# using + operator
result = greet + name
print(result)

# Output: Hello, Jack
```

In the above example, we have used the + operator to join two strings: greet and name.
Iterate Through a Python String

We can iterate through a string using a for loop. For example,
```python
# iterating through  string
data = "laksh"

for i in data:
    print(i)
```

Output
```python
l
a
k
s
h
```
Python String Length

In Python, we use the len() method to find the length of a string. For example,
```python
greet = 'Hello'

# count length of greet string
print(len(greet))

# Output: 5
```
# String Membership Test

We can test if a substring exists within a string or not, using the keyword in.
```python
print('a' in 'program') # True
print('at' not in 'battle') False
```
Methods of Python String

Besides those mentioned above, there are various string methods present in Python. Here are some of those methods:
```				
1. upper() converts the string to uppercase
2. lower() converts the string to lowercase
3. partition() returns a tuple
4. replace() replaces substring inside
5. find() returns the index of first occurrence of substring
6. rstrip() removes trailing characters
7. split() splits string from left
8. startswith() checks if string starts with the specified string
9. isnumeric() checks numeric characters
10. index() returns index of substring			
```
#### Example : 

```python

website = 'www.google.com'

# 1. upper() converts the string to uppercase
print(website.upper())

# 2. lower() converts the string to lowercase
print(website.lower())

# 3. partition() returns a tuple
print(website.partition('.'))

# 4. replace() replaces substring inside
print(website.replace('www.','@'))

# 5. find() returns the index of first occurrence of substring
print(website.find('j'))

# 6. rstrip() removes trailing characters
data = 'Lakshya'
print(data.rstrip(),'this is data -')

# 7. split() splits string from left
print(website.split('.'))

# 8. startswith() checks if string starts with the specified string
print(website.startswith('w'))

# 9. isnumeric() checks numeric characters
data = '90'
print(data.isnumeric())
print(website.isnumeric())

# 10. index() returns index of substring
print(website.index('g'))

```		
	
Escape Sequences in Python

The escape sequence is used to escape some of the characters present inside a string.

Suppose we need to include both double quote and single quote inside a string,
```python
example = "He said, "What's there?""

print(example) # throws error
```


Since strings are represented by single or double quotes, the compiler will treat "He said, " as the string. Hence, the above code will cause an error.

To solve this issue, we use the escape character \ in Python.
```python
# escape double quotes
example = "He said, \"What's there?\""

# escape single quotes
example = 'He said, "What\'s there?"'

print(example)

# Output: He said, "What's there?"
```

Here is a list of all the escape sequences supported by Python.

```			
1. \\ Backslash
2. \' Single quote				
3. \" Double quote
4. \a ASCII Bell
5. \b ASCII Backspace			
6. \f ASCII Formfeed
7. \n ASCII Linefeed
8. \r ASCII Carriage Return
9. \t ASCII Horizontal Tab
10. \v ASCII Vertical Tab
11. \ooo Character with octal value ooo
12. \xHH Character with hexadecimal value HH					
```
		
	
Python String Formatting (f-Strings)

Python f-Strings make it really easy to print values and variables. For example,
```python
name = 'Cathy'
country = 'UK'

print(f'{name} is from {country}')
```

Output
```python
Cathy is from UK
```
Here, f'{name} is from {country}' is an f-string.

Other Example : 

```python
# Python String Formatting


# 1. format()

name = "joy"
age = 12
height = 3.5

print('My Name is {}, age {} and height {} '.format(name,age,height))
print('My height is {2}, age {1} and name {0} '.format(name,age,height))

print('My Name is {}, age {} and height {} '.format("Roy",56,6.5))

# 2. f-Strings

print(f"my name is {name} and age {age}")

```

This new formatting syntax is powerful and easy to use. From now on, we will use f-Strings to print strings and variables.
