# Polymorphism

**Introduction to Polymorphism**

Polymorphism is a key concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common super class. The word polymorphism means "many forms," and in programming, it refers to the ability of different objects to respond, each in its own way, to the same method call.

In Python, polymorphism is implemented through methods in classes. Python supports polymorphism in several ways, including through function overloading, method overriding, and operator overloading.

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Polymorphism with Functions**
2. **Polymorphism with Classes**
3. **Method Overriding**
4. **Polymorphism with Inheritance**
5. **Operator Overloading**

### **1. Polymorphism with Functions**

Polymorphism allows a function to accept objects of different types and behave differently based on the type of the object.

#### **Example:**

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Adding integers
print(add(10, 20))  # Output: 30

# Adding strings
print(add("Hello", " World"))  # Output: Hello World

# Adding lists
print(add([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

In this example, the `add` function behaves differently depending on the types of arguments passed to it. This is a simple demonstration of polymorphism where the same function works for integers, strings, and lists.

### **2. Polymorphism with Classes**

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common class. This is often achieved through method overriding.

#### **Example:**

```python
class Animal:
    def sound(self):
        return "Some sound"

class Dog(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Bark"

class Cat(Animal):
    def sound(self):
        return "Meow"

def make_sound(animal):
    print(animal.sound())

# Creating objects
dog = Dog()
cat = Cat()

# Polymorphism in action
make_sound(dog)  # Output: Bark
make_sound(cat)  # Output: Meow
```

In this example, the `make_sound` function accepts any object that is derived from the `Animal` class and calls the `sound` method on it. The method behaves differently depending on whether the object is a `Dog` or a `Cat`, demonstrating polymorphism.

### **3. Method Overriding**

Method overriding occurs when a subclass defines a method that already exists in its superclass. This allows the subclass to provide a specific implementation of the method.

#### **Example:**

```python
class Vehicle:
    def start(self):
        print("Vehicle is starting")

class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car is starting")

class Bike(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Bike is starting")

# Creating objects
car = Car()
bike = Bike()

# Overriding methods
car.start()  # Output: Car is starting
bike.start()  # Output: Bike is starting
```

In this example, the `start` method is overridden in both the `Car` and `Bike` classes, providing specific implementations for each vehicle type. This is another example of polymorphism, where the same method name results in different behaviors based on the object that calls it.

### **4. Polymorphism with Inheritance**

Inheritance is closely related to polymorphism. Through inheritance, a child class can inherit methods and properties from a parent class. Polymorphism allows those inherited methods to be overridden in the child class, creating a new behavior.

#### **Example:**

```python
class Shape:
    def area(self):
        pass

class Rectangle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height

    def area(self):
        return self.width * self.height

class Circle(Shape):
    def __init__(self, radius):
        self.radius = radius

    def area(self):
        return 3.14 * self.radius * self.radius

def print_area(shape):
    print(f"The area is: {shape.area()}")

# Creating objects
rectangle = Rectangle(5, 4)
circle = Circle(7)

# Polymorphism in action
print_area(rectangle)  # Output: The area is: 20
print_area(circle)     # Output: The area is: 153.86
```

In this example, the `Shape` class is a base class with a method `area`, which is overridden by its subclasses `Rectangle` and `Circle`. The `print_area` function works polymorphically, accepting any object of a type derived from `Shape` and printing the area.

### **5. Operator Overloading**

Operator overloading allows the same operator to have different meanings based on the operands' types. Python provides the ability to overload operators so that they behave differently with objects of user-defined classes.

#### **Example:**

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

    # Overloading the + operator
    def __add__(self, other):
        return Point(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"

# Creating objects
point1 = Point(2, 3)
point2 = Point(4, 5)

# Using the overloaded + operator
result = point1 + point2
print(result)  # Output: Point(6, 8)
```

In this example, the `+` operator is overloaded to add two `Point` objects by adding their respective coordinates. The `__add__` method is used to define how the `+` operator behaves for `Point` objects.

### **Advantages of Polymorphism**

1. **Code Reusability:** Polymorphism allows for writing more generic code that works with different types of objects.
2. **Flexibility:** It provides the flexibility to define specific behavior in child classes while maintaining a common interface.
3. **Ease of Maintenance:** Polymorphism makes the code more maintainable and scalable, as changes can be made in a specific subclass without affecting other parts of the program.
4. **Improved Readability:** By using polymorphism, the code can be more intuitive and easier to understand, as the same operation applies to different types of objects.

### **Polymorphism in Real-World Scenarios**

Polymorphism is widely used in real-world applications to design flexible and scalable systems. For example, consider a payment system where different payment methods like credit cards, debit cards, and digital wallets are supported. Polymorphism allows a common interface to be used for processing payments, while each payment method implements its specific processing logic.

#### **Example:**

```python
class PaymentMethod:
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        pass

class CreditCard(PaymentMethod):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing credit card payment of {amount}")

class DebitCard(PaymentMethod):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing debit card payment of {amount}")

class DigitalWallet(PaymentMethod):
    def process_payment(self, amount):
        print(f"Processing digital wallet payment of {amount}")

def make_payment(payment_method, amount):
    payment_method.process_payment(amount)

# Creating objects
credit_card = CreditCard()
debit_card = DebitCard()
digital_wallet = DigitalWallet()

# Polymorphism in action
make_payment(credit_card, 100)    # Output: Processing credit card payment of 100
make_payment(debit_card, 50)      # Output: Processing debit card payment of 50
make_payment(digital_wallet, 30)  # Output: Processing digital wallet payment of 30
```

In this example, the `PaymentMethod` class defines a common interface `process_payment`, which is implemented by the `CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, and `DigitalWallet` classes. The `make_payment` function can process any payment method polymorphically, allowing the code to be more flexible and extensible.
