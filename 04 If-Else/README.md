## 1. Introduction to Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to execute code based on whether a certain condition is true or false. They help control the flow of a program by allowing different actions to be taken based on the outcome of a condition.

### Why Conditional Statements are Important

Conditional statements are fundamental in programming because they enable decision-making. Without conditional statements, programs would only execute sequentially without any ability to react to different inputs or conditions.

## 2. The if Statement

The `if` statement is the simplest form of a conditional statement in Python. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a specified condition is true.

### Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # block of code to be executed if the condition is true
```

### Example

```python
a = 10
b = 5

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")  # Output: a is greater than b
```

In this example, the code inside the `if` block will execute only if the condition `a > b` is true.

---

## 3. The else Statement

The `else` statement is used in conjunction with the `if` statement to execute a block of code if the condition in the `if` statement is false.

### Syntax

```python
if condition:
    # block of code to be executed if the condition is true
else:
    # block of code to be executed if the condition is false
```

### Example

```python
a = 10
b = 20

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
else:
    print("a is not greater than b")  # Output: a is not greater than b
```

In this example, the code inside the `else` block will execute because the condition `a > b` is false.

---

## 4. The elif Statement

The `elif` statement, short for "else if," is used to check multiple conditions. It is used after an `if` statement and before an `else` statement.

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
elif condition2:
    # block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
else:
    # block of code to be executed if none of the above conditions are true
```

### Example

```python
a = 10
b = 20
c = 30

if a > b:
    print("a is greater than b")
elif b > c:
    print("b is greater than c")
else:
    print("c is the greatest")  # Output: c is the greatest
```

In this example, the code inside the `elif` block will execute if the condition `b > c` is true. If neither the `if` nor the `elif` conditions are true, the code inside the `else` block will execute.

---

## 5. Nested if-else Statements

You can nest if-else statements inside other if-else statements to create more complex conditions.

### Syntax

```python
if condition1:
    # block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
    if condition2:
        # block of code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are true
    else:
        # block of code to be executed if condition1 is true and condition2 is false
else:
    # block of code to be executed if condition1 is false
```

### Example

```python
a = 10
b = 20
c = 15

if a > b:
    if a > c:
        print("a is the greatest")
    else:
        print("c is greater than a and b")
else:
    if b > c:
        print("b is the greatest")  # Output: b is the greatest
    else:
        print("c is the greatest")
```

In this example, the code uses nested if-else statements to determine the greatest value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

---

## 6. The Ternary (Conditional) Operator

The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, provides a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.

### Syntax

```python
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

### Example

```python
a = 10
b = 5

result = "a is greater" if a > b else "b is greater or equal"
print(result)  # Output: a is greater
```

In this example, the ternary operator checks the condition `a > b` and assigns the corresponding value to `result`.

---

## 7. Practical Examples

### Example 1: Checking for Even or Odd

```python
number = int(input("Enter a number: "))

if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"{number} is even")
else:
    print(f"{number} is odd")
```

### Example 2: Grading System

```python
marks = int(input("Enter your marks: "))

if marks >= 90:
    grade = 'A'
elif marks >= 80:
    grade = 'B'
elif marks >= 70:
    grade = 'C'
elif marks >= 60:
    grade = 'D'
else:
    grade = 'F'

print(f"Your grade is: {grade}")
```

### Example 3: Voting Eligibility

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```
